# Reinventing the Internet

## 1. The History of the Web

Today, the internet is part of everyday life. People read news, watch videos, click links, and use web browsers without thinking much about where all this came from. However, the question *“Who invented the internet?”* does not have a simple answer.

The confusion comes from the fact that **“the internet” can mean different things**:

* To engineers and computer scientists, the internet is a **global network of interconnected computers**, developed in the 1970s.
* To everyday users, the internet usually means **websites, browsers, links, and web pages**.

The second meaning — the one most people experience — did not exist until the **early 1990s**.

### Tim Berners-Lee and the World Wide Web

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a British computer scientist named **Tim Berners-Lee** reinvented how people access information on the internet 🌐. What he created is properly called the **World Wide Web (WWW)**, often shortened to *the web*.

Between **1986 and 1991**, Tim Berners-Lee worked at **CERN**, a European scientific research center in Geneva, Switzerland. Scientists at CERN needed a better way to organize and share research documents. Scientific articles usually reference other articles, forming a network of connected information.

Berners-Lee realized that computers could manage these references automatically. His idea was to create documents that could **link directly to other documents**, allowing readers to jump from one source to another instantly.

A modern example of this idea is **Wikipedia**, where articles link to related topics and reference lists. This structure closely resembles Tim Berners-Lee’s original vision for the web.

### Core Technologies of the Web

The World Wide Web is built on **three key technologies**:

1. **HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)**
   Used to structure documents containing text, images, and links.

2. **Web Browser**
   A program that reads HTML files and displays them in a user-friendly format.

3. **HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)**
   A communication standard that allows browsers and servers to exchange data.

Tim Berners-Lee did not invent all of these from scratch. Instead, he **standardized** them into a single system that could work everywhere. HTML was based on an older standard called **SGML**, and many HTML tags originated from it.

In **1990**, Tim Berners-Lee wrote the **first web browser**, called *WorldWideWeb*, making the web usable for real people for the first time.

## 2. HTML Is Not a Programming Language

HTML is **not** a programming language. It never has been.

A programming language can perform calculations, make decisions, and control program logic. HTML does none of these things. Instead, HTML is a **markup language** used to describe the structure of a document.

An HTML document is simply **text with special tags** that tell a browser how to display the content.

### Purpose of HTML

HTML is used to:

* Define headings and paragraphs
* Insert images
* Create links
* Emphasize text (bold, italic)
* Organize content in tables or lists

For example, a simple article might include:

* A title
* A paragraph of text
* An image
* Bolded key points
* A link to another resource

The browser displays this content in a readable format for humans, while the HTML code remains easy for computers to process and for authors to edit.

### Example of HTML Markup

```html
<h1>Domestic Cat</h1>
From the standpoint of scientific classification, domestic cats are
<a href="http://">mammals</a> in the cat family of the carnivore order.
<b>They are considered a separate biological species.</b>
<img src="cat.jpg">
```

The tags give meaning to the content, allowing browsers to present it correctly.

## 3. The Emergence of the HTTP Protocol

The term **HTML** includes the word *hypertext*. Hypertext refers to documents that contain **links to other documents**.

To make hypertext work across a network, a communication standard was needed. This is where **HTTP** comes in.

### What Is HTTP?

**HTTP** stands for **Hyper Text Transfer Protocol**.
It defines how:

* A browser requests a page
* A server responds with data
* Information is transferred across the web

You can see HTTP (or HTTPS) at the beginning of most web addresses.

Example:

```
http://google.com/logo.jpg
```

The protocol name appears first, followed by a colon and two slashes.

Tim Berners-Lee later joked that if he had known how popular the web would become, he might have chosen a shorter protocol name — since it appears in nearly every web link worldwide.

### A Living Inventor

Tim Berners-Lee is still alive today and continues to advocate for an open and accessible web. His work is used by **billions of people every day**, making the World Wide Web one of the most influential inventions in human history.

### Summary

* The internet and the World Wide Web are not the same thing
* Tim Berners-Lee invented the **World Wide Web**, not the internet itself
* The web is built on HTML, browsers, and HTTP
* HTML is a **markup language**, not a programming language
* HTTP enables data transfer between browsers and servers
