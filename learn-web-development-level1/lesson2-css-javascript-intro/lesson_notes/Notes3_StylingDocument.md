# Document Styling in HTML

## 1. Text Styling

HTML provides simple tags that allow us to structure and style text content. These tags help make documents easier to read and understand for users.

### Paragraphs (`<p>`)

The `<p>` tag is used to define a **paragraph** of text. Paragraphs separate content into logical blocks, improving readability and organization.

Each paragraph automatically starts on a new line and has spacing above and below it.

**Example:**

```html
<p>This is the first paragraph of text. It contains some information.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph of text. It is separated from the first paragraph.</p>
```

**Purpose of paragraphs:**

* Group related sentences
* Improve clarity and layout
* Make long text easier to read

---

### Bold Text (`<b>`)

The `<b>` tag is used to make text **bold**. Bold text visually emphasizes important words or phrases.

**Example:**

```html
<p>This is <b>important</b> text.</p>
```

**When to use `<b>`:**

* Highlight key words
* Draw attention to important terms
* Visually emphasize content

---

### Italic Text (`<i>`)

The `<i>` tag italicizes text, giving it a slanted appearance. It is commonly used for:

* Terms or definitions
* Foreign words
* Book or article titles

**Example:**

```html
<p>This is <i>a term</i>, which is italicized.</p>
```

**Note:**
Italic text adds emphasis but usually implies *special meaning* rather than importance.

---

## 2. Headings (`<h1>` – `<h6>`)

Headings are used to define the **structure and hierarchy** of content on a web page. HTML provides six levels of headings.

### Heading Levels

* `<h1>` — The most important heading (main page title)
* `<h2>` — Major section headings
* `<h3>` — Subsections under `<h2>`
* `<h4>` — Subsections under `<h3>`
* `<h5>` — Less important headings
* `<h6>` — The least important and smallest heading

Headings should be used **in order**, without skipping levels.

**Example:**

```html
<h1>Main Page Heading</h1>
<h2>Level 2 Subheading</h2>
<h3>Level 3 Subheading</h3>
```

**Why headings matter:**

* Improve readability
* Help users scan content quickly
* Assist search engines and screen readers

---

## 3. Additional Tags in the Document Head

The `<head>` section of an HTML document contains **metadata** — information *about* the page, not visible in the page content.

### 1. `<title>` Tag

The `<title>` tag defines the **page title** shown in the browser tab.

**Example:**

```html
<title>My First Web Page</title>
```

* Appears in the browser tab
* Used by search engines
* Usually auto-generated by editors

---

### 2. `<meta charset="UTF-8">` Tag

This tag sets the **character encoding** of the document.

**Example:**

```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```

* UTF-8 supports most world languages
* Prevents text display issues
* Almost always included in modern HTML pages

---

### 3. `<meta name="viewport">` Tag

This tag controls how the page is displayed on **mobile devices**.

**Example:**

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

* Makes pages responsive
* Adjusts layout to screen size
* Essential for mobile-friendly websites

---

### 4. `<link rel="stylesheet">` Tag

The `<link>` tag connects an **external CSS file** to the HTML document.

**Example:**

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

* `rel="stylesheet"` specifies the file type
* `href` defines the file path
* Allows separation of structure (HTML) and design (CSS)

---

### 5. `<script src="..." defer>` Tag

The `<script>` tag connects an **external JavaScript file** to the page.

**Example:**

```html
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
```

* `src` specifies the script file
* `defer` ensures the script runs after the page loads
* Used to add interactivity and behavior

---

Perfect 👍 I’ll **add those three sections** to the lesson and keep everything concise, structured, and student-friendly.

## 4. HTML vs CSS Styling

When creating web pages, it’s important to understand the **difference between HTML and CSS** and what each one is responsible for.

### HTML (Structure & Meaning)

HTML defines:

* **What content is**
* **How content is structured**

Examples:

* Paragraphs (`<p>`)
* Headings (`<h1>`–`<h6>`)
* Emphasis (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`)

HTML answers the question:
👉 *“What is this content?”*

---

### CSS (Appearance & Design)

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) defines:

* **How content looks**
* **Visual presentation**

CSS controls:

* Colors
* Fonts
* Sizes
* Spacing
* Layout

Example:

```css
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 18px;
}
```

CSS answers the question:
👉 *“How should this content look?”*

---

### Key Difference Summary

| HTML                | CSS                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Defines structure   | Defines appearance    |
| Describes meaning   | Controls design       |
| Content-focused     | Style-focused         |
| Required for a page | Optional but powerful |

👉 **Rule of thumb:**
Use **HTML for meaning**, **CSS for styling**.

---

## 5. Semantic Tags: `<strong>` and `<em>`

Earlier, we learned about `<b>` and `<i>`. These change how text **looks**, but not what it **means**.

Semantic tags add **meaning** to text — not just visual style.

---

### `<strong>` Tag (Important Text)

The `<strong>` tag indicates **strong importance**.

* Browsers usually display it as bold
* Screen readers emphasize it
* Search engines treat it as important

**Example:**

```html
<p>This is <strong>very important</strong> information.</p>
```

✅ Use `<strong>` when the importance of the text matters.

---

### `<em>` Tag (Emphasized Text)

The `<em>` tag indicates **emphasis**.

* Usually displayed in italics
* Screen readers change voice tone
* Meaning depends on context

**Example:**

```html
<p>This is <em>not</em> what I meant.</p>
```

Here, emphasis changes the meaning of the sentence.

---

### `<b>` vs `<strong>` and `<i>` vs `<em>`

| Tag        | Purpose             |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| `<b>`      | Visual bold only    |
| `<strong>` | Important content   |
| `<i>`      | Visual italics only |
| `<em>`     | Emphasized meaning  |

👉 **Best practice:**
Use `<strong>` and `<em>` instead of `<b>` and `<i>` when meaning matters.
